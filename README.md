This app was originally forked from the google tensorflow codelab (https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2) but now it has diverged into something else:

I practice here a lot of cool technologies: Tensorflow, RxJava2, Viewmodel & LiveData just to name a few.

Currently the PixBadger app would search your device for jpg images and then classify them with tensorflow.

Then it will display all classified images and classification results in real time in a recylerview.
